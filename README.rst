Configuration Manager (configmng)
===================================

Configuration Manager is currently designed only to work with YAML configuration
files. It has for objective to encapsulate in a package features that answer
a few different needs when working with configuration files within a project:

- Use a default configuration file
- Merge different configuration files
- Validate the configuration with a schema

This software is not currently aimed for distribution because it is still unstable and
in designing phases. However, this code is Open-Source and can therefore be used and re-used
at your own convenience.
